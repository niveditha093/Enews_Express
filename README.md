# Enews_Express
E-news Express, an online news portal seeking to expand its subscriber base, the company has created a new landing page to potentially enhance user engagement and drive more subscriptions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this new landing page, an experiment was conducted by randomly assigning 100 users to two groups: one exposed to the existing landing page (control group) and the other to the new landing page (treatment group). Data on user interactions with both landing page versions was collected for analysis.

The objective is to perform a statistical analysis at a significance level of 5% to address the following:

  * To determine if the new landing page design leads to increased user engagement, as measured by the time spent on the page.
  * Whether the new landing page is more effective in persuading users to subscribe, thus impacting the conversion rate positively.
  * The analysis explores whether the choice of language influences user conversion, which could provide insights into potential language-specific optimizations.
  * Assessing whether users of different preferred languages exhibit similar behavior in terms of time spent on the new landing page, helping in understanding language-related user dynamics.
    
In summary, E-news Express aims to leverage data science and statistical analysis to assess the impact of the new landing page design on user behavior and subscription conversion rates. The results of this analysis will inform strategic decisions regarding the optimization of the landing page to enhance user engagement and increase the number of subscribers.

**Conclusions:**

  * **Time Spent on Landing Page:** Users in the treatment group (exposed to the new landing page) spend more time on the landing page compared to the control group (old landing page). This suggests that the new landing page design is more engaging.

  * **Average Time Spent:** On average, users spend more time on the new landing page (mean time spent: 6.2232) compared to the old one (mean time spent: 4.5324), indicating the effectiveness of the new design in retaining user attention.

  * **Language Influence on Time Spent:** There is no significant difference in the average time spent on the landing page across different preferred languages. Users across English, French, and Spanish spend a similar amount of time.

  * **Conversion and Time Spent:** Users who converted spend more time on the landing page (mean time: 6.623148) than those who did not convert (mean time: 3.915870), indicating a positive correlation between time spent and conversion.

  * **Conversion Rates:** The overall conversion rates are higher in the treatment group than in the control group, regardless of the preferred language. Users who viewed the new page were more likely to subscribe (conversion rate: 66%) compared to the old page (conversion rate: 42%)

  * **Language-Specific Conversion Rates:** In the treatment group, conversion rates have significantly increased for both French and Spanish users compared to the control group. This indicates that the new landing page design resonates better with users of these languages.

  * **Statistical Significance:** The p-values from the statistical tests provide strong evidence to reject the null hypotheses, confirming that the new landing page leads to greater time spent and higher conversion rates compared to the old landing page.

**Business Recommendations:**

  1. **Adopt the New Landing Page:** Implement the new landing page as the primary design, as it keeps users engaged for longer and results in higher conversion rates.

  2. **Continuous Monitoring:** Continue to monitor user behavior and conversion rates to ensure the effectiveness of the new landing page over time. Make adjustments as needed.

  3. **Localized Content:** While language doesn't significantly impact conversions, consider offering content in multiple languages to cater to diverse audiences.

  4. **Content Personalization:** Explore personalization options based on user preferences and behavior to further enhance engagement and conversion rates.

  5. **Marketing Emphasis:** Invest in marketing strategies to drive more traffic to the new landing page, leveraging its higher conversion potential.

  6. **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback to refine the landing page continually and improve the overall user experience.
